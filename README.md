# Internship-At-Cadre-Design
Here are some key details about my internship at Cadre Design for VLSI Design using EDA Tools

**Introduction:**

This repository showcases the work I completed during 15 days of my online internship at cadre design, where I designed and simulated semiconductor devices using Cogenda Visual TCAD. The focus of this project includes:

-->Junction Diode Design and Simulation. (Understanding Part)
-->NMOS Transistor Fabrication and Analysis. (Evaluation)
-->PMOS Transistor Fabrication (Derived from NMOS) and Analysis. (Evaluation)
-->Each project includes design details, measurements, simulation results. (Output)

**First, Let me explain what is the Tcad?**

--> TCAD (Technology Computer-Aided Design) refers to a suite of simulation tools used to model, design, and analyze semiconductor devices and processes in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design. TCAD plays a crucial role in the development of advanced semiconductor technologies by enabling engineers to predict the behavior of devices and optimize their performance before actual fabrication.

**What is Cogenda Visual Tcad and what are the key features of it?**

--> Cogenda Visual TCAD is a comprehensive software suite designed for simulating the design, fabrication, and operation of semiconductor devices. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing simulations, making it accessible for both beginners and experts. The tool is widely used in research and development for understanding device physics, optimizing semiconductor processes, and developing advanced devices such as MOSFETs, diodes, and optoelectronic components.

Here are the **key features** of Cogenda Visual TCAD:

-2D/3D Device Simulation – Models electrical characteristics.
-Process Simulation – Simulates doping, etching, and oxidation.
-User-Friendly GUI – Easy design and simulation setup.
-Advanced Physics Models – Includes quantum effects, carrier transport, and thermal modeling.
-Doping & Material Customization – Custom doping profiles and semiconductor materials.
-Results Visualization – Graphical representation and export of simulation data.
-Support for Emerging Devices – Works with FinFETs, FDSOI, and photonics.
-High Accuracy – Adaptive meshing and robust solvers for precise results.
-Versatile Applications – Suitable for research and industrial development.
